# Perl-to-Python-Code-Convertor

Perl2Python:

A tool to attempt conversion of Perl scripts to Python 2.7. 

Use:

Run the script on the command line. Argument 1 needs to be the file to translate (multiple files will be ignored).

Output will be written to stdout

If a line is unable to be translated, it will be output as a comment. You'll need to check this manually, as no warnings will be thrown and this can cause serious breakage.
